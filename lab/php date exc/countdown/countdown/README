The Countdown script is a somewhat simple script, which takes the time you give 
it and tells you the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds 
until that event will occur.  More details on how to use this script are below.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT CONTAINS:
        This script comes with 3 different files:
                1) countdown.pl - The Perl script which does the calculation 
                                  of the time until an event will occur.
                2) README - The file that does all the explaining.
                3) countdown.html - An example of ways to incorporate 
                   countdown.pl and use it properly.


You will have to do some minimal configuration of the countdown.pl file:

COUNTDOWN.PL -
        The countdown.pl file is the main file in this package.  This file 
needs to be placed in the server's cgi-bin or have its name changed to 
countdown.cgi.  Keep in mind the latter option only works should your server 
be set up to treat all .cgi files in a script manner.  If you are not sure 
about this, consult your system administrator.  Inside the countdown.pl file 
you can do one of two things:

        1) If you plan to just call the same date every time from this 
           script, change the @from_date variable to the date you want it 
           to countdown to.  This can include all the way up to seconds.  The
           format for this should look like:

              @from_date = (yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss);

                Where:
                        yyyy - The Year in Four Digits.
                        mm   - The first mm is the month number from 1-12.
                        dd   - The Day of the month.  Values range from 1-31.
                        hh   - The hour of the day.  Values range from 0-23.
                        mm   - The second mm is the minute of the hour from 
                               0-59.
                        ss   - The ss stands for seconds and the value can 
                               range from 0-59.

        2) If you plan to call different dates via a html page, you don't have 
           to worry about setting any variables inside the script.

At any rate you will probably want to edit the subroutines &html_header and 
&html_trailer, to customize it for your wants/needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I IMPLEMENT THIS?!

1) If you have defined the @from_date in the countdown.pl file and you wish to 
   only call the same value each time, you can simply do the following:

   <a href="http://your.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl">Countdown to ...</a>

   When the user clicks on this they will be taken to a cgi generated page that
   tells them the countdown status.

2) Should you want to use this counter for various countdown you can also call 
   a specific date directly from the link, in the same fashion as you would 
   have defined @from_date. (See Above for info on how to define @from_date.)
   Let's say I want to countdown to my birthday in 1996.  My birthday is 
   April 15: 4/15, so I would do something like:

    <a href="http://my.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl?1996,4,15,0,0,0">Countdown 
    to my birthday!</a>

3)  Allow users to countdown to their own dates!  If you want to do this you 
    would use the following syntax:

    <FORM METHOD=GET ACTION="http://your.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl">
    <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=""><P>
    <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
    </FORM>

    Then when the user types in his/her query the program will generate an 
    automatic response.  Make sure to let your users and yourself know that 
    the format for the query must match the exact same definition as @from_date. 
    (See Above for info on how to define @form_date.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADVANCED FEATURES OF COUNTDOWN!

In Some situations it may be impractical to count out to seconds.  Or maybe if 
you are counting down to something closer than year, you will want to leave 
out the year portion of the countdown since it is only going to be 0 all the 
tie anyways.  Or maybe the same goes for month, day, etc...  Countdown has a 
built in feature to allow you to do this.  Instead of defining all categories 
in @from_date you can do the following:

1) Say I want to leave out the year in the countdown to my birthday (From the 
   example above.) I could also do this:

    <a href="http://my.server/cgi-bin/countdown.pl?XX,4,15,0,0,0">Countdown
    to my birthday!</a>

   When the user gets the returned html document, the # of years will not be 
   shown.  You can put an 'XX' in any of the fields (year, month, day, hour, 
   minute, second) and it will disregard that amount of time.

2) You can also define the same way inside of the countdown.pl.  If you are 
   using a standard countdown, meaning that you see no need for  multiple 
   countdowns, you can set your @from_date in your Perl script to reflect this 
   (This concept is also mentioned above).  You can substitute in 'XX' for any 
   amount of time you don't want. (Be it year, month, day, hour, minute, or
   second)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER USEFUL THINGS COUNTDOWN DOES BEHIND THE SCENES:

1) Will not return a negative value.  Often times you would see a negative 
   number of hours.  Instead, when countdown comes across a negative value, it 
   simply adds the correct number (12 for months, appropriate number for days, 
   24 for hours, 60 for minutes and seconds).  It then subtracts one from the
   next highest category so that your time comes out perfect, and all in 
   positive time.  Years will appear in negative time, since if you are that 
   far behind, you're messed up!  :)

2) Calculates number of days in each month,and recognizes leap years to!

3) Notices the difference between 1 hour and 2 hours.  So that you get proper 
   English instead of 1 hours. Works the same for other units.

HISTORY:
Version 1.0             9/1  - Script Created.
Version 1.1             9/3  - Improved the script based on suggestions by 
                               Scott Lipcon:
                               - Added an extra 0 to the seconds and minutes 
                                 if the times were less than ten, so the 
                                 clock came out looking like 5:00:00 instead
                                 of 5:0:0
                               - Changed the '.' in the time to a ':' between 
                                 seconds and minutes so that clock looks 
                                 like: '5:00:00' instead of '5:00.00'
                               - Corrected the leap year system, so that it 
                                 will get leap years correct.
                               - Commented the file better.
                             - Edited the README file slightly.
Version 1.2             9/8  - Several bugs fixed based on the obersvations by 
                               Elton Taupin.
                               - Bug fixed that caused current date to be 
                                 screwed up when the time was < 10 minutes.  
                                 The problem had something to do with a 
                                 misplaced colon.
                               - Fixed a bug in the countdown portion of the 
                                 script, which caused an extra date to be 
                                 displayed on the countdown on certain 
                                 instances.  It was a case of subtracting 
                                 from $month, instead of $real_month.
Version 1.21                   - Slight bug with 1 too many months fixed.
                   12/27/99    - Fixed small Y2K date problem
